# Format All The Things!

This is a bash script that will run `clang-format -i` on your code.

Features:

 * Finds the right path to `clang-format` on Ubuntu/Debian, which encode the
   LLVM version in the `clang-format` filename
 * Fixes files recursively
 * Detects the most common file extensions used by C/C++ projects

Basic usage:

    clang-format-all src/  
    ./check-all.py --root_dir src/

`check-all.py`	will not modify files, it will just check them. When any file is non-compliant to style, it returns a non-zero error code. This is extremely useful for CI workflows.
Advanced usage:

    clang-format-all project1/ project2/ project3/

**Note:** While `clang-format` is a powerful tool for enforcing a consistent
coding standard, you should be aware that different versions of `clang-format`
may format the same code differently. As one example that I know of, in C++ long
vector or set literals (say, a dozen elements or more) in `clang-format` 3.7 are
generally formatted with one entry per line, but under `clang-format` 3.5 the
same literals may be formatted with multiple entries per line if the entries are
short enough. Therefore if multiple people are contributing to the same project,
you should strive to ensure that they're all using the same version of
`clang-format`.
